originally positionned in : 
/usr/local/lib/node_modules/lorawan-fota-signing-tool

Modification have been made to cli.js to add support for external ddelta signing. -> The delta is not applied directly in the signing-tool but externally, you still have to reference the bins of the versions, to be able to have informations about size of the bin. This is used in signature.
The Diff info of the signature is then signed with 0x02

Diff Info : 
	0x0 -> not an update (full binary)
	0x1 -> JDIFF update
	0x2 -> DDelta update (compressed using Ari Compressor)
